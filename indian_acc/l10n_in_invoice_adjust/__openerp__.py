Adjust Customer and Suppliers Invoices
=========================================
This module helps you to adjust Customer and Suppliers Invoices from the same party. You can reconcile customer and suppliers account against each other.

How it works?
+++++++++++++++++
When a company or contact is supplier as well as customer, you can adjust payments of your customer and supplier invoices from this same company or contact.

**Example:**

* Agrolait, Customer Invoice for Sales = $1000
* Agrolait, Supplier Invoice for Purchases = $900

Create Customer Payment and select Agrolait as customer and the system will automatically adjust $1000 Credit with $900 Debit entries. So you can collect only $100 from Agrolait. Both the invoices will be paid once you reconcile the entries.
