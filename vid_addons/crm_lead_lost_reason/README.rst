Crm Lead Lost Reason
========================

When an opportunity is lost, a reason must be given,
it is chosen from a configured list.
(strongly inspired from sale_cancel_reason addon)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

 * For now, this addon forces the user to use the red button "Mark Lost" on form:
   this is the only way where it's easy (i.e. without dealing with javascript)
   to display a pop-up wizard for the user to indicate a lost reason.
