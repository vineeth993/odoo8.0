Configure how every stage must behave in every sales team. Same stage can behave differently per Sales Team, for example duration allowed to stay at stage, user responsible etc. Init Config button guesses what kind of default configuration could be for sales team by looking at used stages in that Sales Team. Using it might speed up configuration for user. <strong>Note.</strong> If you 'New' stage probability is 0, you need to change to be something higher than 0. Because 0 probability means that opportunity is lost. Also stages workflow stops if opportunity probability is 0 or 100.
